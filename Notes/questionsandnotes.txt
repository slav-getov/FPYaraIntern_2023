Notes:
1. I get super confused when it comes to which method to await and whether we should do that at all
2. Found ts kinda difficult without prior utilization and explanations.
3. Most of the 'extending guards' methodology in the documentation felt like magic methods and just copying stuff without explicitly knowing what is what
