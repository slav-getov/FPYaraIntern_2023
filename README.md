# Hello and welcome

This is my final project for YARA BG. This project will use **POSTGRESQL**, **NEST.js**, **React.js** and other tech.

## Demo ERD!

This is how the entity relations look

### Instructions for running the project

1. I have worked in the nestauth branch. Use that branch to view my update work. There were several branches since I had issues with implementing proper reg/login.
2. To start up the backend server, go to /backend folder and run npm run start:dev
3. To start up the frontend vite server, go to /frontend and run npm run dev
4. Currently I only have the backend and some Registration/Login logic with tokens.
5. Thanks
